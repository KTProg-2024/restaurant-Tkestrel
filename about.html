      <p class="subtitle">A Brief History</p>
      <p class="para">In the year 6969, Tobi and Toby met in Freshman year, at the highschool they had<br>
      in common. Realizing they both had the same burning passion for pizza as the other, they became<br> 
      fast friends. Throughout their 4 years at Jp Keefe  Technical School, they coined a dream to one<br>
      day own a multi-million dollar pizza restaurant chain. They would call it "Tobi and Toby's Pizza<br>
      Cabin"; after their favorite family owned restaurant in Framingham MA, the "Pizza Hut".</p>
